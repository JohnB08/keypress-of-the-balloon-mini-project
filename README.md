# keypress-of-the-balloon-mini-project

Practising using objects and DOM manipulation + eventlisteners.

A simple game using letter keys on a keyboard as input to remove spawning divs

To play: type each letter as they spawn. There is no timelimit on how long a letter can remain on screen,
but if too many letters are spawned at once, the player will start loosing life, and eventually game over.
